Project 1: Saving Ukraine
By Benjamin Bowdon, Emily Mathew, Evan Chung, and Caleb Gardner
Using HRF09 and a tan tank
Section 1: Hacking into the Tankâ€™s Mainframe to Fry the Engine

Part A: Recording the signal
The signal was recorded using osmocom_fft


Part B: The signal was analyzed using Inspectrum

Amplitude Shift Keying
27.15 MHz
48.96 ms
At .55 (microseconds?) signal gets weird

Part C: The signal was cleaned and deconstructed using URH (Universal Radio Hacker)

Part D: The signal was replayed using GnuRadio



Section 2: Preventing Russian Military from Controlling Tank
Part A: Active Targeted Jamming (as opposed to Passive White Noise Jamming)
For this project, we chose to do active targeted jamming instead of passive white noise jamming. This method has a much larger effective range than the white noise jamming. 

Part B: Signal Selection using URH


Part C: Signal Replay using GnuRadio




(Both jamming and signal replay were demoed to Nick)
