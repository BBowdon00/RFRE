## Part A: Recording the signal.

The signal was recorded using osmocom_fft

## Part B: The signal was analyzed using Inspectrum

Amplitude Shift Keying
27.15 MHz
48.96 ms
At .55 (microseconds?) signal gets weird

## Part C: The signal was cleaned and deconstructed using URH (Universal Radio Hacker)

## Part D: The signal was replayed using GnuRadio

## Part A: Active Targeted Jamming (as opposed to Passive White Noise Jamming)
For this project, we chose to do active targeted jamming instead of passive white noise jamming. This method has a much larger effective range than the white noise jamming. 

## Part B: Signal Selection using URH

(Both jamming and signal replay were demoed to Nick)
