# Section 1: Finding the elusive, top secret North Korean radio station

## Part A: Using QSpectrumAnalyzer
The first task of this project was to find the radio station on the spectrum. According to some top secret intel, the station frequency hopped every few minutes so we needed a good way to find the signal each time. QSpectrumAnalyzer was set up for frequency sweeping with 1 GHz bandwith. The first time we saw the signal was at 1.26 GHz. We quickly opened GQRX to play the radio station.

## Part B: Using GQRX
Once we found the signal with QSpectrum Analyzer, we looked at that frequency in GQRX. Using wideband frequency modulation, we played the radio station and heard the North Korean national anthem, played along with a display of Kim Jong Un's face. In the middle of the broadcast, morse code plays audibly.
